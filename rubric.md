# Rubric
## Technical Requirements
Progressing/Performing - You have a 3 model application. I feel as though this code base relies heavily on existing resources. There are comments from our lesson plans verbatim. I would encourage you greatly, to try and build this application again. And rely on those resources less.

## Creativity/Interface
Progressing - There really isn't much in the way of differences between this app and the Ruby on Rails Guides tutorial. Again, would strongly encourage you to see how you can personalize this app and make it your own.

## Code Quality
Performing - Code is generally well formatted. There is a bit of code that isn't being used. I would get rid of that.

## Functionality
Performing - All of this applications CRUD is fully functional. I implore you, though, break out of your shell! These tutorials and lesson plans are here to help guide you through how these things were coding work. This app is largely based off those existing apps. Truly test your knowledge by creating something that you can call your own.
